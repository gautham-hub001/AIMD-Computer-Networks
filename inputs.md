SmoothEff(0.5,40,60,100)



1st -> 
2nd -> has the initial code nested in two for loops which varies the values for A and B. After each iteration, the A, B, responsiveness, smoothness and the mean values for X1 and X2 are written into a .csv file.
A which ranges from 40 to 60, incremented by 10
B from 0.1 to 0.9 incremented by 0.1
responsiveness
smoothness
mean value for X1
and mean value for X2

This will prove helpful for data analysis and will direct our project toward a more specified goal.
